# IPLMapGen2 aka **maps.iplabs.ink**

## What is this?
maps.iplabs.ink is a web based tool to create map lists for competetive Splatoon events. It was created with a focus on making it as easy as possible to create, edit, and share map lists.

## How to use
Visit https://maps.iplabs.ink/ to use the tool. It should function on all modern browsers ignoring minor visual inconsistencies. First, you must create a pool of maps that can appear for each mode, then add your round info, and finally choose a generate option. Once a map list is generated, you can edit it by clicking on the map or mode. The app will only let you pick maps within the mode's pool. When you're finished, you can export it as a shareable URL, a discord message, or a JSON file the IPL livestream software can import.
